Just testing out the system and seeing what I can do. I will have to get a better hold of the `markdown` language.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Taylor')
#=> prints 'Hi, Taylor' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
